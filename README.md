# Local Marketplace SelfCheckoutSystem

This is one of my first projects exposing me to a vast group of ~25 people. We all were able to understand eachother despite being on different skill levels.

Please use the zip file in the main branch if you would like to look at the project locally, or go to the master branch look at the project from github!
